20.
	Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence 
of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
Example 1:
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1

CODE:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int findFirstOccurrence(const char* haystack, const char* needle) {
    char* occurrence = strstr(haystack, needle);
    if (occurrence != NULL) {
        return occurrence - haystack;
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    const char* haystack = "sadbutsad";
    const char* needle = "sad";
    int index = findFirstOccurrence(haystack, needle);
    printf("The first occurrence is at index %d\n", index);
    return 0;
}


OUTPUT:

The first occurrence is at index 0
