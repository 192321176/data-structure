2.
You are given an undirected graph G(V, E) with N vertices and M edges. We need to 
find the minimum number of edges between a given pair of vertices (u, v).
Examples: 

Input: For given graph G. Find minimum number of edges between (1, 5).

123

Output: 2
Explanation: (1, 2) and (2, 5) are the only edges resulting into shortest path between 1 and 5.

coding 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int graph[5][5] = {
        {0, 1, 0, 0, 0},
        {1, 0, 1, 0, 1},
        {0, 1, 0, 0, 1},
        {0, 0, 0, 0, 1},
        {0, 1, 1, 1, 0}
    };

    int u = 1, v = 5;
    int minEdges = graph[u-1][v-1];

    printf("Minimum number of edges between (%d, %d): %d\n", u, v, minEdges);

    return 0;
}

output 

Minimum number of edges between (1, 5): 0
