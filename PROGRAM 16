	Write a program to find odd number present in the data part of a node
Example Linked List 1->2->3->7
Output: 1,3,7

CODE:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};

void findOddNumbers(struct Node* head) {
    struct Node* current = head;

    while (current != NULL) {
        if (current->data % 2 != 0) {
            printf("%d ", current->data);
        }
        current = current->next;
    }
}

int main() {
    struct Node* head = NULL;
    struct Node* second = NULL;
    struct Node* third = NULL;
    struct Node* fourth = NULL;

    head = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    second = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    third = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    fourth = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));

    head->data = 1;
    head->next = second;

    second->data = 2;
    second->next = third;

    third->data = 3;
    third->next = fourth;

    fourth->data = 7;
    fourth->next = NULL;

    printf("Odd Numbers in the Linked List: ");
    findOddNumbers(head);

    return 0;
}

OUTPUT:

Odd Numbers in the Linked List: 1 3 7
